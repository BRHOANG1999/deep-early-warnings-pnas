#### *Deep learning for early warning signals of regime shifts*. In review at *PNAS*, 18 May 2021 <https://doi.org/number_here> Thomas M. Bury [![](https://orcid.org/sites/default/files/images/orcid_16x16.png)](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1595-9444), R. I Sujith, Induja Pavithran, Marten Scheffer, Timothy M. Lenton, Madhur Anand, and Chris T. Bauch. 


## Requirements

Python 3.7 is required. To install python package dependencies, use the command

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
preferably within a new virtual environment.

The bifurcation continuation software AUTO-07P is required. Installation instructions are provided at
http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~gabriel/auto07/auto.html


## Directories

**/figures_pnas:** Code to generate figures used in manuscript.

**/test_models:** Code to simulate and compute early warning signals for the test models. These include the Consumer-Resource model, May's harvesting model and an SEIRx model.

**/test_empirical:** Code to pre-process and compute early warning signals for the empirical datasets (see below).

**/training_data:** Code to generate training data for the deep learning algorithm. Execute the script *run_job.sh* to generate two models and time series for each bifurcation type [~1 minute].
