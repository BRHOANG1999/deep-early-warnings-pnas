## Directories

**/figures_pnas**: Code to generate figures used in manuscript.

**/test_models**: Code to simulate and compute early warning signals for the test models. These include the Consumer-Resource model, May's harvesting model and an SEIRX model.

**/test_empirical**: Code to pre-process and compute early warning signals for the empirical datasets. These include Sedimentary archives from the Mediterranean Sea, thermoacoustic instability, and paleoclimate transitions.
